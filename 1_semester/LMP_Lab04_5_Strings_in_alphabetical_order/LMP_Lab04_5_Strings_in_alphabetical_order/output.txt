Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me
Because I'm easy come, easy go
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Caught in a landslide
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
Didn't mean to make you cry
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Look up to the skies and see
Mama, just killed a man
Mama, life had just begun
Mama, ooo
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
